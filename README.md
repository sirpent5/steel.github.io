# Streamline
<i>A smarter way to watch</i>

## Problem
With the growing popularity of streaming services, it's hard to keep track of what's available to watch and where. 
Many people end up overspending on services and keeping subscriptions that don't benefit them. 

## Our Hack
Streamline uses the Watchmode API, MySQL, and AWS Databases to store information about movies and tv shows available 
on the top streaming platforms. Users can input their preferred genres and streaming budget to recieve a plan or package
of services that is best suited for their needs. Additionally, Streamline allows users to compare two streaming services and visualize the overlap between their libraries. This allows customers to make better use of their money, and get more out of
their subscription services. <br>
